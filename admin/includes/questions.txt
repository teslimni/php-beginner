MySQL

# How do I join two tables together in MySQL?
# I have a challenge creating a schema for a
survey database I am working on. The survey is
a teacher performance appraisal for students
to score their teachers on a range of 1-10.
The survey has a series of questions, up to
10 for each teacher.
The app will allow the school to create as many
surveys for teachers or staff as they want.
So I created three tables called surveys, categories
and instructions. 
The Surveys table contains: id, survey_items(the questions).
The categories contains: cat_id, cat_name; and 
the instructions caontains: id, survey_id, instructions, author, and date.
My main challenge is that I don't know how to make sure I can save all the 
survey question as signle entry in the survey_item column, so that whenever
I SELECT a survey_item id, all the questions are returned together as an 
array I can loop through.



OOP
# Does method overloading occur within a class only
or can it occur between classes?

# Is the case of a class instance (i.e an object) 
a case of inheritance to the class?



Interview

I used to work for a religous ngo in Nigeria
as a research staff on issues bordering on 
interfaith and peaceful co-existance. I got 
tired of the talks without actions. So after
my 4th year I decided to leave and start my 
own faithbased online media project being a
graduate of Linguistics and Journalism. 

I got mesmerized with the technology (WordPress).
On a particular occassion, my logo wasn't showing
up correctly. I knew no html or css then. So I
decided to get someone to do it for me. It was 
going to cost me $130 to fix just a logo. 

There and then, I decided it was time to kill the
media project and have a change of career so I started 
learning online at learnable.com, then treehouse.com, etc.
